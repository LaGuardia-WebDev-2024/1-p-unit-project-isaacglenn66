<h1>Reasons I'm Late to Web Development</h1>
<h4>Lack of Sleep</h4>
    <p>I may or may not have a sleep disorder! Whenever I lie down I have trouble breathing. I always wake up tired whether I slept 10 hours, 14 hours, or 6 hours. These things make it extremely difficult for me to get out of bed.</p>
    <h4>Anxiety</h4>
    <p>In addition to my sleep problems I also have major anxiety! Whenever I wake up my heart is always racing. Whenever my dad is home he wakes me up for school, but if he is working he cannot wake me up and I must rely on my own skills. </p>

    <p>I realized recently that I cannot lie in bed once my alarm goes off and I just have to get up <strong>immediately</strong>. Therefore, I was on time for Fiorello Friday this morning.</p>

<h4>Senior Jazz</h4>
<p>On some Fridays I am late for another reason other than my poor judgment. <br>Today, (September 19) I was late because I had to help cleanup for Jazz Orchestra where I play 2nd trombone. <p>

<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
<p>None of these things are an <em>excuse</em>! I am simply explaining my situation and making light of it. Hopefully next week I'll be on time, but I'll always make sure to keep up with the classwork.</p>

<p>(in order to follow the rubric I will now create a presentation about jazz.)</p>

<h4>My Favorite Jazz Musicians</h4>
